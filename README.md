# lucene-unity
Adaptation of Lucene.NET to work with Unity3D, including coroutine and behaviour facades.

## Installation
This repo is designed to be used as a submodule of an existing Unity3D repo.  E.g.

```git submodule add https://github.com/aakison/lucene-unity.git Assets/Lucene```

There are no demo scenes or resources in this repo, just the required files so that your solution is not polluted with unnecessary files.

## Usage

Once installed, you have full access to the Lucene.NET port of the Lucene library.
For complete usage examples, please see the official Lucene documentation at the [http://lucene.apache.org/](http://lucene.apache.org/).

For simplicity, there is a wrapper designed for use with Unity which provides an easier interface for Unity apps.
To get started, use the `Lucene3D` class.
